# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks

For QBS181 2019 Fall Term, this repository is to showcase the code from SQL and R for given assignments, presentations, and projects assigned through the term. 

Permission was granted by Dartmouth College and faculty to make this work public. 

## Project 1

Project 1 provided the task of working in SQL and handling the data. One such task was renaming columns permanently, working with dates in SQL, and replacing values with other values for clearer understanding. Making new columns based on values of other columns. This was mainly to show our understanding of how to handle and clean data using SQL with a SQL Data Studio, which was done on Azure Data Studio for this project.
