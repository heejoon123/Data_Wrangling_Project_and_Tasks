# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks

For QBS181 2019 Fall Term, this repository is to showcase the code from SQL and R for given assignments, presentations, and projects assigned through the term. 

Permission was granted by Dartmouth College and faculty to make this work public. 

## Project 1

Project 1 provided the task of working in SQL and handling the data. One such task was renaming columns permanently, working with dates in SQL, and replacing values with other values for clearer understanding. Making new columns based on values of other columns. This was mainly to show our understanding of how to handle and clean data using SQL with a SQL Data Studio, which was done on Azure Data Studio for this project. The specific tasks are outlined below.

1. Rename the columns: 
  a)TriAge to Age
  b) GenderCode to Gender
  c) ContactID to ID
  d) Address1Stateorprovince to State
  e) TriImagineCareenrollmentemailsentdate to EmailSentdate
  f) Trienrollmentcompletedate to Completedate
  g) Calculate the time (in days) to complete enrollment and create a new column to
      have this data

## Project 2

Project 2 provided the task of working in SQL within Rstudio to handle data further. This required connecting to the SQL server via ODBC in R, and then loading the data into Rstudio as a dataframe. This also required knowledge of how to work with dates, as visualization tools for the data such as ggplot() in R.
